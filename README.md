# BlackJack
This is an intermediate version of BlackJack coded in the language of Java. 
Although it is text-based it still is a challenge when coding it as it requires a proficient application of BlackJack rules.
This game uses the IBIO class (which has been added to the files as well) in order to take input from the user.
